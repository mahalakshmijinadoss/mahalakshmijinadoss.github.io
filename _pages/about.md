I am a Masterâ€™s student in Artificial Intelligence at Oregon State University, advised by Dr. Karthika Mohan and Dr. Weng-Keen Wong. My research focuses on evaluating causal structure learning algorithms for different data types. I am seeking full-time opportunities starting December 2024. 

This summer, I interned at NVIDIA as a Generative AI intern, where I implemented a GraphRAG pipeline that integrates LLM-generated knowledge graphs to enhance Retrieval-Augmented Generation systems.

Previously, I was a Data Scientist/ Researcher at Tattle, where I was advised by Tarunima Prabhakar and Denny George. Here, I contributed to building open-source tools and datasets to analyze and mitigate the spread of false and harmful information.

Prior to that, I worked on data curation and evaluation for Machine Translation for low-resource Indian languages at AI4Bharat under the guidance of Dr. Pratyush Kumar and Dr. Mitesh Khapra

I love food, transit, games, and rolling around in the grass. Feel free to check out my CV and drop me an email if you want to chat with me!
