I am a masters student in Artificial Intelligence at Oregon State University. I am looking for full time opportunities starting December 2024!

This summer, I interned at NVIDIA as a Generative AI intern, working on integrating knowledge graphs generated by large language models (LLMs) into Retrieval Augmented Generation systems.

Previously, I was a Data Scientist/ Researcher at Tattle, where I was advised by Tarunima Prabhakar and Denny George. Here, I contributed to building open source tools and datasets to analyze and mitigate the spread of false and harmful information.

In my free time, I like to read, bake, play board games, and roll around in the grass. Feel free to check out my CV and drop me an email if you want to chat with me!
