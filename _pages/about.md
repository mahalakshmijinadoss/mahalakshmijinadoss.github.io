I am a Masterâ€™s student in Artificial Intelligence at Oregon State University, advised by Dr. Karthika Mohan and Dr. Weng-Keen Wong. My research focused on evaluating causal structure learning algorithms on simulated and real-world datasets. I am actively seeking full-time opportunities in Machine Learning, Causal Inference, and Natural Language Processing.

This summer, I interned at NVIDIA as a Generative AI intern, where I worked on integrating LLM-generated knowledge graphs to enhance the performance of Retrieval-Augmented Generation systems.

Previously, I was a Data Scientist/ Researcher at Tattle, where I was advised by Tarunima Prabhakar and Denny George. Here, I contributed to building open-source tools and datasets to analyze and mitigate the spread of false and harmful information.

Before that, I worked on data curation and evaluation for Machine Translation for low-resource Indian languages at AI4Bharat under the guidance of Dr. Pratyush Kumar and Dr. Mitesh Khapra

I love food, transit, games, and rolling around in the grass. Feel free to check out my CV and email me if you'd like to chat!
